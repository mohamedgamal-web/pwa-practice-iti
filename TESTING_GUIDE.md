## Prerequisites

### Required Tools
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Browser Developer Tools
- Local development server (already included in project)

### Browser Recommendations
- **Chrome**: Best PWA support and debugging tools
- **Firefox**: Good PWA support with excellent debugging
- **Safari**: iOS PWA testing
- **Edge**: Windows PWA testing

## Basic Setup Testing

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
npm run dev
# or if using a simple HTTP server
python -m http.server 3000
# or
npx serve -p 3000
```

### 2. Verify Basic Functionality
1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
2. Check that all three pages load correctly:
   - Main page (`/index.html`)
   - Other page (`/other.html`)
   - Another page (`/below/another.html`)
3. Verify navigation between pages works
4. Check that CSS styles are applied correctly

## Service Worker Testing

### 1. Service Worker Registration
1. Open **Developer Tools** (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for these messages:
   ```
   Service Worker is supported
   Service Worker registered successfully
   Service Worker: Installing...
   Service Worker: All static files cached successfully
   Service Worker: Activated and ready
   ```

### 2. Service Worker Status Check
1. In **Developer Tools**, go to **Application** tab (Chrome) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
2. Click on **Service Workers** in the left sidebar
3. Verify:
   - Service worker is **Active and Running**
   - Source shows `/sw.js`
   - Status shows **activated**

### 3. Service Worker Updates
1. Make a small change to `sw.js` (e.g., change cache version)
2. Refresh the page
3. Check console for update messages
4. In Application tab, click **Update** to force update

## Offline Functionality Testing

### 1. Test Offline Mode

2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Check **Offline** checkbox (or throttle to "Offline")
4. Refresh the page
5. **Expected Result**: Page should still load from cache

### 2. Test Navigation Offline
1. While offline, navigate between all pages
2. **Expected Result**: All pages should load instantly from cache
3. Check console for "Serving from cache" messages

### 3. Test Interactive Features Offline
1. While offline, test:
   - Counter functionality on main page
   - Form submission on other page
   - Game functionality on another page
2. **Expected Result**: All features should work, data should persist in localStorage

### 4. Test Network Status Detection
1. Go to main page
2. Toggle online/offline status
3. **Expected Result**: Network status indicator should update in real-time

## PWA Installation Testing

### 1. Install Prompt Testing (Desktop)
1. Visit the site in Chrome
2. Look for install button in address bar or wait for automatic prompt

   - No address bar visible
   - App behaves like native application

### 4. App Shortcuts Testing
1. Right-click on installed PWA icon (desktop)
2. **Expected Result**: Context menu shows shortcuts to "Other Page" and "Another Page"
3. Click shortcuts to test direct navigation

## Caching Strategy Testing

### 1. Cache Inspection
1. In **Developer Tools** â†’ **Application** â†’ **Storage**
2. Click on **Cache Storage**
3. Expand cache entries
4. **Expected Result**: See cached files including HTML, CSS, JS, and manifest

### 2. Cache-First Strategy Testing
1. Load a page while online
2. Go offline
3. Reload the same page
4. Check **Network** tab - should show "(from ServiceWorker)"
5. **Expected Result**: Page loads instantly from cache

### 3. Cache Update Testing
1. Modify a CSS file
2. Update cache version in `sw.js`
3. Refresh page
4. **Expected Result**: New version should be cached and served

### 4. Dynamic Caching Testing
1. While online, navigate to a page not in initial cache
2. Go offline
3. Navigate to that page again
4. **Expected Result**: Page should load from cache (was cached on first visit)

## Interactive Features Testing

### 1. Main Page Features
1. **Counter Test**:
   - Click increment/decrement buttons
   - Refresh page - counter should persist
   - Go offline and test - should still work

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Service Worker Not Registering
- **Problem**: Console shows service worker registration failed
- **Solution**: 
  - Check that you're serving over HTTPS or localhost
  - Verify `sw.js` file exists and is accessible
  - Check for JavaScript errors in service worker

#### PWA Not Installable
- **Problem**: No install prompt appears
- **Solution**:
  - Ensure manifest.json is properly linked
  - Check that all manifest requirements are met
  - Verify service worker is registered and active
  - Use HTTPS (or localhost for testing)

#### Offline Mode Not Working
- **Problem**: Pages don't load when offline
- **Solution**:
  - Check that service worker is caching files correctly
  - Verify cache names match in service worker
  - Check Network tab for cache hits
  - Clear cache and re-register service worker

#### Cache Not Updating
- **Problem**: Changes don't appear after updates
- **Solution**:
  - Update cache version in service worker
  - Use "Update on reload" in Application tab
  - Clear browser cache manually
  - Check cache strategy implementation

#### Features Not Working Offline
- **Problem**: Interactive features fail when offline
- **Solution**:
  - Ensure features use localStorage, not network requests
  - Check that all required files are cached
  - Verify service worker is handling requests correctly

### Debug Tools

#### Chrome DevTools
- **Application Tab**: Service worker status, cache inspection, manifest validation
- **Network Tab**: Cache hits, service worker requests
- **Console**: Service worker logs and errors
- **Lighthouse**: PWA audit and recommendations

#### Firefox DevTools
- **Storage Tab**: Service worker and cache inspection
- **Network Tab**: Service worker request handling
- **Console**: Debug messages and errors

6. **User Testing**: Have real users test the PWA experience

## Conclusion

This testing guide covers all aspects of PWA functionality. Regular testing ensures your PWA provides a reliable, app-like experience across all platforms and network conditions. Remember that PWA features may vary between browsers and platforms, so comprehensive testing is essential for a good user experience.
